## Blog Application

This repository contains a basic Django blog application. It provides the foundation for creating and managing blog posts.

### Structure

The application follows the standard Django project structure:

* `admin.py`: Defines how the `Post` model will be displayed in the Django admin panel.
* `apps.py`: Configures the application within the Django project.
* `models.py`: Defines the `Post` model, which represents a blog post.
* `tests.py`: Contains unit tests for the application's functionality.
* `urls.py`: Defines the URL patterns for accessing the application's views.
* `views.py`: Defines the views responsible for handling requests and generating responses.

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your database settings in `settings.py`.

4. Run the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

This is a basic template for a blog application. You can build upon this foundation by adding features such as:

* User accounts and authentication
* Commenting system
* Post categories
* Search functionality
* RSS feeds
